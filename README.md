# GoogleSheetsInstantShortcuts
An experiment to try adding a keyboard shortcut visualizer to Google Sheets so I could remember them better. Done via a Chrome extension that would just listen to the keypresses and add some extra UI.

Still kinda buggy and not that great, so have abandoned this, but was fun to work with.
